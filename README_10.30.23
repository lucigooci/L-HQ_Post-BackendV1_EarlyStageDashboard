#Overview

//Basically set up the backend mongodb "Library" and the Express.js "Library view" (basically the access points to pull the data) 
like login, registration, etc. And when it came time to pivot into the Dashboard/Frontend things got messy

I didnt realize how critical the organization was so I took some time to reorganize the whole project - currently there is a file called 
"SNEAT_DASHBOARD_TEMP_INSTILLATION" - I had ran against the wall several times trying to install this VUE.js dashboard template I bought
but its being a pain - it became messy and so I was inspired to clean my shit up. 

I havent deleted the "sneat" thing yet, but I wanted to start the process of regularly saving my version controls cuz now I'm worried that
with all the banging against the wall trying to make this dashboard work, I may have lost some parts of the early pieces. 

Glad to be building the habit now. Will test function once the dash is set up.
